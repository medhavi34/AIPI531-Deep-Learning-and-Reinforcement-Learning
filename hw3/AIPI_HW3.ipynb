        "## Observations from the Results\n",
        "The comparison between the two models reveals distinct patterns. Key metrics, including cumulative rewards, hit rate (hr), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (ndcg) at various top-k recommendations (5, 10, 15, 20), highlight the impact of incorporating item features. This improvement is evident when contrasting outputs from SNQN_new.py and SAC2_new.py (without item features) with SNQN_Features_new.py (with item features). Notably, across both models, performance metrics show enhancement with an increasing number of top-k recommendations, aligning with typical trends in recommender systems. The decline in loss over batches for both models indicates ongoing learning and optimization. Interestingly, enough we find that SNQN model performs much better than SAC2 model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model featuring item features seems to perform comparitively to its counterpart, maybe if we provided better item features we would see that item features elevate the recommendation quality. This effect is particularly pronounced for cold items/users.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "The approach and results align seamlessly with the specified requirements. The successful training and comparison of session-based DRL recommenders, with and without item features, underscore the effectiveness of including such features in enhancing recommendation performance, especially in the context of e-commerce applications."
